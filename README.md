This project is not finished. I decided to pause and leave it, in case I choose to come back to finish. This uses myphpAdmin and MySQL, Apache (for database). The repository folder contains a SQL connector, which hasn;t been set up yet. This project uses a GUI form which cannot be displayed on html. For my own purposes, I require html, which is why I'm currently discontinuing this project for the time being. The GUI form has been created for the Registration page with all the necessary fields and two buttons. The buttons have actions already created. The fields are not currently connected to anything.
